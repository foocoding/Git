# Git
This repository contains the course material for the Git course :octocat:.

We think that learning Git is one of the useful skills to become a successful and efficient software engineer. The aim of this course is to learn the basics of Git and not to be an expert.

We want to use this repository as an archive of course material (slides/tutorials), useful resources, teaching ideas etc.

Also check out our Git [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVYDhqbgYpYUGxRdtQdYVE5Q8h3bt6SIA) for tutorials
